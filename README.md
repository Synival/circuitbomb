*A BOMB IS ABOUT TO GO OFF!*

Disable the bomb's circuitry before you're exploded into exploedy bits!

## How to play Circuit Bomb:

- Each level has a set of switches hooked into a circuit with various logic
  gates.  The object is to flip the switches correctly to disable the circuit.

- If the countdown reaches zero before the circuit is disabled, a bomb will
  explode, unceremoniously ending the game as well as your career on the bomb
  squad.

- Flip switches by clicking them.

- A correct circuit will immediately disable the bomb, advance you to the next
  level and add an extra (10 + level) seconds for each level to the timer.

- Each level will an an extra switch to the circuit.
